# Database Practice 05
- This is the 5th practice for PKU spring lecture Introduction to Database, the professor of which is Lijun Chen. 
- The topic this time is data analysis based on SQL.
- See this project also at GitHub.com @204265271. 
- Honestly speaking, I didn't expect to have another practice after Practice 4 because the ddl of it is already set after the final exam. However, I'm still willing to do this practice anyway. (LOL)

# Some Explanation to the Details
- [Task Chosen] as a group of 2, we need to do the first 2 tasks and choose another 1 among task 3, 4, 5. Hence, we choose **Task 1, Task 2 and Task 3**. 
- [SQL Chosen] this time, we've retained the tradition of using MySQL, because the database management of python - mysql is easier than SQLite3. (I don't need to remove the *.db files after doing an experiment, let alone the path controlling.)
- [Task 1] I've found that there're 7 movies with no genre in the movies.csv. It seems that there're also David's deer in the movie world. 
- [Task 2] It seems that I need to supplement my knowledge about stocks first.
- [Task 2] I have to say that after learning stock knowledge this task is just a piece of cake. 
- [Task 3] The structure of the tables are **different** between (2015, 2016, 2017) and (2018, 2019). 
- [Task 3] MySQL does not support the function of multiple linear regression, so I replaced it with the corresponding function of numpy instead.
